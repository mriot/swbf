# Note on file format

I utilized the .asm file extension, as the code in question is actually written in Assembly language.  
However, I believe the actual file format is a _Cheat Engine Auto Assembler_ specific syntax. To improve readability, I modified the comments from `//` to their Assembly language equivalent `;` to enable GitHub's syntax highlighting.

If you want to use the code, you can download the Cheat Table here. :)
